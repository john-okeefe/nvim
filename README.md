Created with the help of the one, the only, ThePrimeagen from YouTube video [0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE), and modified by me!

My modifications mostly include adding the surround, nvim-treesitter-endwise and nvim-autopairs plugins and a few more lexers to meet my needs.
